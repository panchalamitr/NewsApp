# News App

I have made News App using MVVM architecture.

There are three screens
-
1) Login Screen (Google, Facebook Login) 
2) Top 5 news headlines
3) Detail Screen
-------------------------
I have used following tools


 - Timber (For Log purpose)
 - RxJava ( For Async Operation)
  - DaggerHilt ( Dependancy Injection)
 - Retrofit (Network Call)
 - LoggingInterceptor (Api Logs)

**Description**

1) Login Screen (Google, Facebook Login) 
I have done login operation in SocialLoginActivity 

2) NewsHeadLinesActivity
I have fetch data from the (The Guardian Open Platform) API and displayed those records. 
I have followed MVVM Architecture in this screen 
I have created NewsHeadLinesActivityas UI, NewsHeadLinesViewModel as ViewModel and NewsHeadLinesRepository as Repository

3) DetailNewsActivity
Here I just need to display 5 to 10 lines of detail description, but I could not found detail description so I have load that webpage using Webview.
